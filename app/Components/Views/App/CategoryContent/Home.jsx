    <p>Welcome to the Climate Change Guide!</p>

      This is a <strong>progressive web app (PWA)</strong> with some basic information on what
      individual decisions you can make to help prevent climate change.

      What is a Progressive Web App? Itâ€™s an application hosted on a web browser. What makes it cool
      is that you can download it, so <strong>it can work offline.</strong>

    <p>
      This project was originally done just as a small side project to learn more about PWAs. If you
      want to learn more about PWAs, you should go check out Google's documentation{' '}
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">here</a>

    <p>If you're curious about if this actually works offline, give it a shot!</p>
    <p>
      If you're using a{' '}
      <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/">supported browser</a>, try
      turning off your wifi/internet and navigating to a different page on this site. You should
      still see stuff render (though some pictures might be missing, since some of them do need a
      internet connection for the initial load). Depending on your operating system (Android, etc),
      you can even add a shortcut to your desktop!
